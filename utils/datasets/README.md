# Datasets
Repository that stores a set of databases that can be used to assess pattern recognition algorithms.

## Contributing
To contribute, please make a fork of  the [**brains**](https://github.com/omadson/brains) repository and insert a folder with the dataset name, in the appropriate place. The diretory must contain a `date .csv` file with the values of the dataset; and a `README.md` file with information about this. See a model in `real/iris/`. By the end, just make a `pull-request` with your dataset if it meets the requirements described herein, it will be incorporated into the repository.

There are two directories: `artificial/` and `real/` according to the data source.
